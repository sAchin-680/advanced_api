- **GraphQL Integration**: Flexible data querying with GraphQL endpoints.
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket support for real-time updates.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for fast and scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for robust data handling.
- **Redis**: Caching layer to optimize performance.
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication for secure user sessions.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication using WebSockets.
- **Apollo Server**: GraphQL support for flexible API queries.
- **Swagger**: Automatic generation of interactive API documentation.
- **Jest & Supertest**: Comprehensive testing tools for unit, integration, and e2e tests.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing and running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4 or higher)
- Redis (for optional caching)

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced_api.git
cd advanced_api
```
### Installation Steps

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required variables (refer to the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section).

### Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
## Environment Variables

In the `.env` file, configure the following:

```plaintext
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRATION=1h

# Other configurations
NODE_ENV=development
```
## Usage

Once the server is running, the API will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You can interact with the API using Postman or any other API testing tool.

### Available Routes

| Method | Endpoint                | Description               |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| GET    | /api/v1/products        | Fetch all products        |
| POST   | /api/v1/products        | Create a new product      |
| GET    | /api/v1/products/:id    | Fetch a product by ID     |
| PUT    | /api/v1/products/:id    | Update a product by ID    |
| DELETE | /api/v1/products/:id    | Delete a product by ID    |

For authentication routes and other features, please check the API documentation below.

## API Documentation

Advanced_api uses Swagger for API documentation. After starting the server, you can view the interactive API docs at:

```bash
http://localhost:5000/api-docs
```
## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests written using Jest and Supertest.

To run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components such as controllers or services.
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between different components like routes and controllers.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate real-world scenarios and test the entire API flow.
## Real-time Features

Advanced_api supports real-time communication through Socket.IO. This allows for features like live updates, notifications, and real-time data streaming.

To connect to the WebSocket server:

```javascript
const socket = io('http://localhost:5000');
```
